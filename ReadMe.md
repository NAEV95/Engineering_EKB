# Project Description

This project focuses on the prediction of mutation effects on protein function using MD simulations, feature extraction, and machine learning models. The project consists of the following steps:

1. Production of MD Simulations: Conducted molecular dynamics simulations to study the behavior of proteins and their mutations. 

2. Extraction of Features: Extracted relevant features from the MD simulations to construct a tabular dataset for further analysis.[Bash_scripts](**/scripts)

3. Training and Analysis of ML Models: Utilized shallow machine learning models and a neural network to train and analyze the dataset for predicting mutation effects on protein function [Python_scripts/Averages_Datasets_Light_copy.ipynb](Python_scripts/Averages_Datasets_Light_copy.ipynb).
